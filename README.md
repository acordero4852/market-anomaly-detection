# Market Anomaly Detection

## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the market dataset, handle missing values, and perform data preprocessing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generate descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand data distribution and relationships.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Compute and visualize the correlation matrix (could maybe say correlation heatmap here?) to identify relationships between features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and select important ones for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Isolation Forest) to detect market anomalies.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using classification reports and other metrics.
- **Visualization**: Plot various graphs to visualize feature distributions, correlations, and model results.

## Tech Stack Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization library for plotting graphs.
- **Seaborn**: Visualization library for statistical graphics.
- **scikit-learn**: Library for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

## Project Structure

- **README.md**: Project description and documentation.
- **detection.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data loading, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **market_data.csv**: Dataset used for the project.
